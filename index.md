title: Secret Santa picker?
---
This is a Secret Santa picker, that will help a single person organize and participate in a Secret Santa gift exchange without knowing the assignments. Each individual will be privately emailed their assignment. All participants will receive an email from **picker@secretsanta.dev**. After submitting, please ensure all participants have received their assignments, emails may be filtered to a spam folder.

If you have an issue or a feature request, please create an [issue](https://github.com/stephenrlouie/SecretSanta/issues). If you require assistance or want to provide feedback you can also email [help@secretsanta.dev](mailto:help@secretsanta.dev)

## How is this different?
Secret Santa Picker App does not store any information. All information that is submitted is ephemeral and only known during the runtime of the application. Sent emails are deleted shortly after they are sent. We do not have ads. We also support anti-affinity assignments for secret santa exchanges.

## What is anti-affinity?
A member of a group cannot receive or give a gift to another member in the same group.

For example, if we have four couples exchanging gifts. You would create four groups, each containing a couple. This will ensure those couples will not be assigned to each other.

For an exchange of six individuals, you would create 6 groups each with one member. 

## Example Email

Here's a link from \<ADMIN-NAME> with more information: \<LINK>

Merry Christmas!!
